The lexer.GCU-PL file is the sample code input getting fed into the lexer.

The syntax.GCU-PL file is the output from the lexer of the token, tpe and line number, which is also the input file into the syntax analyzer.

Syntax.py should run fine as long as the syntax.GCU-PL file is located in the same directory.
